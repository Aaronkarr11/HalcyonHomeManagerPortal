                        The <strong>Halcyon Home Manager</strong> is a tool to help track and manage work around the house.
                        It also contains several other features such as an item tracker (shopping list) and a dashboard to
                        visualize completed work. Other features are planned to be included in future releases.

                        The application is <strong>strictly client side.</strong> Data is only stored on the user’s device. As such, if the
                        end user deletes the app or a faulty update was released, all data could be lost and cannot be recovered.
